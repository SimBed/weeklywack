							In this workshop, you will learn about the 72,000 ???nadis??? or electrical circuits in the human body,

							<ol class="GeneralText">
								<li>The health and shape of our physiques</li>

							The nadis develop blockages or granthis through unbalanced living and if left unchecked create physical pain
							and disease. The yoga postures practiced correctly will help open up the flow of Prana in the body allowing
